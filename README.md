Mars Rover Kata
==========

#Description
==========
Develop an api that moves a rover around on mars surface
- You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
- The rover receives a character array of commands.
- Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
- Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
- Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
- Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle.


#Test
To run the tests just run:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit

```
You need PHP 5.6 or above to run it since we have phpunit 5.2.


If you have legacy version of php please change composer.json file
and include the version that is compatible with you version of PHP


If you change the phpunit version do not forget to run:

```
./composer update --with-dependencies

```
